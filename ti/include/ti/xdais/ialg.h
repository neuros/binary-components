 *              This pointer may be @c NULL; however, in this case, algAlloc()

 *              implementation.  Otherwise, this pointer is not set.  algAlloc()
 *              may elect to ignore the @c parentFxns pointer altogether.
 *
 *  @post       For each memory descriptor in memTab with an #IALG_WRITEONCE
 *              attribute, the algorithm has either set the base field to a

 *              allocated and initialized memory buffer of the indicated
 *              'size', or has set the base field to @c NULL, thereby

 *  @remarks    @c params is a pointer to algorithm-specific parameters that
 *              are necessary for the creation and initialization of
 *              the instance object.  This pointer points to the same
 *              parameters passed to the algAlloc() operation.
 *              However, this pointer may be NULL.  In this case,
 *              algInit(), must assume default creation parameters.
 *
 *  @remarks    The algorithm <b>must not</b> access any scratch resources,
 *              memory or otherwise, until it has been activated (see
 *              algActivate()).  A common error is to initialize
 *              scratch resources during algInit().  This is an error
 *              as <i>another</i> algorithm, or instance of the same
 *              algorithm, may be active when this instance's
 *              algInit() is called.  This algorithm must not access
 *              scratch resources until it is active.
 *
 *  @remarks    The client is not required to satisfy the IALG_MemSpace
 *              attribute of the requested memory.  Note however that
 *              C6000 algorithms that use DMA may strictly require the
 *              client to satisfy its on-chip memory requirements and
 *              may not function correctly otherwise.
 *
 *  @remarks    The client may allocate the requested #IALG_WRITEONCE
 *              buffers once (or never, if the algorithm has assigned
 *              a base address in the prior call to algAlloc) and use
 *              the same buffers to initialize multiple instances of
 *              the same algorithm that are created with identical
 *              parameters.
 *
 *  @par Example:
 *
 *  @code
 *      typedef struct EncoderObj {
 *          IALG_Obj ialgObj;
 *          int workBuf;
 *          Int workBufLen;
 *          ... ;
 *      } EncoderObj;
 *
 *      Int algInit(IALG_Handle handle, IALG_MemRec memTab[], IALG_Handle p,
 *          IALG_Params *algParams)
 *      {
 *          EncoderObj *inst = (EncoderObj *)handle;

 *
 *          if (params == NULL) {
 *              params = MYDEFAULTPARAMS;
 *          }
 *
 *          inst->workBuf = memTab[1].base;
 *          inst->workBufLen = params->frameDuration * 8;
 *          ...
 *
 *          return (IALG_EOK);
 *      }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @pre        @c memTab contains pointers to non-overlapping buffers with
 *              the size and alignment requested via a prior call to
 *              algAlloc().  In addition, the algorithm parameters,
 *              params, passed to algAlloc() are identical to those
 *              passed to this operation.
 *
 *  @pre        @c handle must be a valid handle for the algorithm's
 *              instance object; i.e., <tt>handle == memTab[0].base</tt> and
 *              @c handle->fxns is initialized to point to the
 *              appropriate IALG_Fxns structure.
 *
 *  @pre        If the prior call to algAlloc() has not assigned a non-NULL
 *              base address to an #IALG_WRITEONCE @c memTab entry,
 *              the client must provide the memory resource with the
 *              requested size and alignment.
 *
 *  @pre        If the prior call to algAlloc() returned a non-NULL parent
 *              functions pointer, then the parent handle, @c parent,
 *              must be a valid handle to an instance object created
 *              via that function pointer.
 *
 *  @pre        No other algorithm method is currently being run on this
 *              instance.  This method never preempts any other method
 *              on the same instance.
 *
 *  @pre        If parent is non-NULL, no other method is currently being
 *              run on the parent instance; i.e., this method never
 *              preempts any other method on the parent instance.
 *
 *  @pre        If the prior call to algAlloc() assigned a non-NULL base
 *              address to an #IALG_WRITEONCE @c memTab[] entry, the
 *              client may pass back the same address in the base
 *              field without allocating additional memory for that
 *              persistent write-once buffer. Alternatively, the
 *              client may treat #IALG_WRITEONCE buffers in the same
 *              way as #IALG_PERSIST buffers; by allocating new memory
 *              and granting it to the algorithm using the base field.
 *
 *  @pre        The buffer pointed to in @c memTab[0] is initialized
 *              with a pointer to the appropriate IALG_Fxns structure
 *              followed by all 0s.
 *
 *  @post       With the exception of any initialization performed
 *              by algActivate() and dmaInit(), all of the instance's
 *              persistent and write-once memory is initialized and
 *              the object is ready to be used.
 *
 *  @post       All subsequent memory accesses to the #IALG_WRITEONCE
 *              buffers by this algorithm instance will be read-only.
 *
 *  @post       If the algorithm has implemented the IDMA2 interface,
 *              the dmaGetChannels() operation can be called.
